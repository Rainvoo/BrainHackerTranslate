Ever faster processors, cheaper sensors, abundant open-source code, ubiquitous connectivity, and the advent of 3D printing are some of the forces behind the recent proliferation of robots. As I see things, these forces will only get stronger, and as more [robots become part of our lives](http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/home-robots/so-where-are-my-robot-servants)—in homes, offices, factories, hospitals, and many other places—we’ll inevitably face challenges involving our adoption and use of robots.

> 我观察到，这些力量只会更加强大，随着更多的机器人融入我们的生活——家里、办公室、工厂、医院和许多其他地方——我们在采纳和使用机器人时，将不可避免地面临一些挑战。

Some observers are voicing their [fears about a decline in human-human interaction](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/books/review/Lehrer-t.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0), while others warn of an irreversible and senseless loss of jobs, with [robots taking over tasks that, they argue, should not be performed by machines (such as caring for the elderly)](https://medium.com/message/failing-the-third-machine-age-1883e647ba74). Trade-offs will certainly be part of our growing reliance on robotics and automation. And it will be up to us to manage these trade-offs, just as we have with other technologies such as electricity, the automobile, aviation, nuclear power, computers, and the Internet.

> 我们对机器人和自动化日益依赖，利益权衡，毫无疑问将成为这一过程的一部分，并得由我们自己完成，就像我们在其他技术上干过的那样，比如电力、汽车、航空、核电、计算机和互联网。

As a VC looking for investment opportunities in robotics, I talk to lots of different people about their views on the future of this industry. Many times what I hear from these people are totally contradictory, so I often have to come up with my own conclusions. Below I present a list of what I consider are five pressing issues concerning robotics—and I identify each as a myth or a fact. My hope is that they can provoke some thought and debate among engineers, policy makers, consumers, and investors. Let me know what you think.

## Robots are intended to eliminate jobs: MYTH

> ## 迷思：机器人将减少工作岗位？

Almost every major manufacturing and logistics company I’ve spoken to looks to robotics as a means to improve the efficiency of its operations and the quality of life of its existing workers. So human workers continue to be a key part of the business when it comes to robotics. In fact, workers should view robots as how skilled craftsmen view their precision tools: enhancing output while creating greater job satisfaction. 

> 我所聊过的几乎每个大型制造业公司或物流业公司，都将机器人视为提升它们运转的工作效率和现有工人的生活质量的一种手段。因此，即便有了机器人，人类工人仍然是这些行业的关键部分。事实上，工人们应当像能工巧匠们看待精密仪器那样，来看待机器人：提高输出效率，且更满意地工作。

[Tesla Motors](http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/transportation/advanced-cars/teslas-5billion-battery-factory-spending-big-to-save-big) is just one example of using robots [pictured above] to [do all the limb-threatening and back-breaking tasks](http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/industrial-robots) while workers oversee their operation and ensure the quality of their output. At Tesla’s assembly lines, robots glue, rivet, and weld parts together, under the watchful eye of humans. These workers can pride themselves with being part of a new era in manufacturing where robots help to reinvent and reinvigorate existing industries like the automotive sector.

> 特斯拉汽车，就是使用机器人来完成所有危险和繁重工作的一个例子，工人们只需要监督机器人的运作和确认它们的产出质量，在特斯拉的流水线上，他们看着机器人将不同的部件胶合、固定、焊接在一起。机器人帮助改造和振兴了诸如汽车行业这样的现有产业，这些工人，可以自豪地成为这一制造业新时代的一份子。

## Manufacturing and logistics must adopt robots to survive: FACT

> ## 事实：制造业和物流业必须采用机器人才能生存

Although total cost of ownership is a popular yardstick used for purchasing capital equipment, payback time is more commonly used for automating basic (typically arduous) worker tasks. 

> 虽然总成本是购置设备时重要的衡量标准，但对于基础（通常也是艰苦）的工作任务的自动化，通常用回收期来衡量。

If we use pick-and-place as an example, one estimate says that each work “cell” (or equivalent of one worker) costs $32.5k/year (not including benefits) for a single shift in the United States. Historically, manufacturing and logistics companies have adopted automation equipment with one-year payback. Therefore, a $65k installed robot, operating on two shifts, is highly desirable. However, the net present value of down time, upgrades, and maintenance must be calculated into the $65k number. 

> 我们以「抓取-放置」作业为例，有预算指出，在美国，每个工作「单元」（或一个工人的当量）花费为 $32.5k/每年·每班（不包括利润）。>>>???从历史上看，制造业和物流企业采用自动化设备，回收期只需一年。所以，一个 $65k 的安置机器人 2 班倒工作，十分合算。然而，停机、升级和维护的花费，也必须折算成净现值，计算到 $65k 这个数字中去。

Labor costs are lower in Asia, where each work “cell” is closer to $20k, though that number is expected to increase sharply. 
It’s not surprising, then, that Asian manufacturers, including Flextronics and [Foxconn, are actively seeking automation technology to increase productivity](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/foxconn-to-replace-human-workers-with-one-million-robots) of their existing workforce and meet increasing demand. And we are already seeing a similar trend in the logistics sector. 

> 在亚洲，劳动力成本更加低廉，尽管预期将大幅增加，每个工作「单元」也只接近 $20k.这并不奇怪，包括伟创力和富士康在内的亚洲制造商，都在积极寻求自动化技术来提升它们现有劳动力的生产率，满足不断增长的需求。我们可以看到，在物流行业也已经有了类似的趋势。

Deregulation and technology brought about the notion of the [third-party logistics provider, also known as the 3PL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_logistics), which offers transportation, warehousing, and pick-and-place to suppliers in a wide variety of product categories and marketplaces. 3PLs compete on their ability to deliver higher-quality services as lower cost to their clients. With technology being responsible for the 3PL’s coming into existence, they continue to spend vast sums on automation in each of their hundreds of warehouses to improve the quality and variety of their logistics offerings—in other words, robotics will allow them to remain competitive and survive.

> 放松管制和科技，带来了第三方物流供应商的概念，也称作第三方物流（3PL），为多种产品和市场的供应商提供运输、仓储和抓取-放置服务。第三方物流的核心竞争力，是以更低的成本，为他们的客户提供更高质量的服务。随着服务于第三方物流的相关技术的面世，它们持续花费海量资金，将它们数以百计的仓库一一自动化，以提升他们在物流供应方面的品质和种类——换言之，机器人让它们保持竞争力，继续生存。

## Autonomous robots are still too slow: FACT

> ## 事实：自主机器人仍然很慢

If you were watching the [DARPA Robotics Challenge](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/darpa-robotics-challenge-trials-results) last year, you would be quick to notice that the robots are awkward and slow at completing even the most basic tasks. Although Moore’s Law has sped up capabilities like machine vision, traditional search-based algorithms for navigating through decision trees are just too slow in runtime. 

> 如果你看过去年的 DARPPA 机器人挑战赛，你会很快注意到那些机器人在完成最基本的任务时，笨拙而缓慢。尽管摩尔定律已经加速了机器视觉方面的能力，>>>???通过决策树导航的传统基于搜索的算法，在运行时仍然很慢。

As the [famous video of PR2 folding towels](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/home-robots/pr2-does-the-impossible-folds-towels) showed, tasks that we take for granted as humans are time-intensive for algorithms—even with the help of the most advanced sensors—to navigate. Significant advances can be made with fundamental algorithmic improvements that take the “brute force” out of machine vision and other tasks. In particular, lots of research are going into pattern recognition, in addition to [handing control over to the “cloud”](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/cloud-robotics) when machine vision algorithms come short.

> 如同著名的 PR2 折叠毛巾的视频展示的那样，>>>???即使在最先进的传感器的帮助下，叠毛巾这种我们人类认为理所当然的任务，用算法去导航，也是时间紧张的。>>>???可以通过改进基础算法，来帮助机器人执行「暴力破解」机器视觉或其他任务时，取得显著进步。尤其，大量研究开始进入模式识别，在机器视觉算法变短时，将控制权移交给「云」。

## Robots are too expensive: MYTH

> ## 迷思：机器人很贵

Modern household appliances are examples of dedicated pieces of hardware that people buy without thinking twice. These devices benefit from decades of incremental improvement, and millions of units in the field over which development and tooling costs are spread out. The same could apply to robots. The problem, though, is that robots still require specialized—and costly—hardware. In particular, actuators are among the most expensive parts in almost every robot, and unlike processors and sensors like cameras, the cost of actuators is not coming down at a significant pace. 



Consider, for example, Willow Garage spinout [Industrial Perception](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/startup-spotlight-industrial-perception). Before [being acquired by Google](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/google-acquisition-seven-robotics-companies), the startup managed to get close to human speed in identifying and unloading assorted boxes from a container. But although its robotic system used inexpensive sensors like a few cameras and Microsoft Kinect devices, it still required a relatively expensive robot arm powered by conventional actuators. The good news is I believe we’re about to see a lot of innovation in actuation systems—and that will finally bring the cost of robots down, as it happened to appliances. One promising area involves the special sensor-equipped joints that allow robots to control their motions in a precise and safe way. Groups such as CMU-spinout [IAM Robotics](http://www.iamrobotics.com/), [Redwood Robotics](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/redwood-robotics-brings-big-names-to-next-gen-robot-arms)([acquired by Google](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/google-acquisition-seven-robotics-companies)), and [Modbot](http://modbot.com/) are using unique approaches to reduce the number and simplify the motors, gears, and sensors needed, hence dramatically reducing the cost of the arms, which in most cases dominate the cost of the entire robot.

## Robots are difficult to use: FACT

[Rethink Robotics’ Baxter](http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/industrial-robots/rethink-robotics-baxter-robot-factory-worker) is one example of a robot designed to be affordable and simple to program. However, those qualities come at the [expense of the speed and precision associated with traditional industrial robots](http://www.everything-robotic.com/2012/09/rethink-robotics-launches-baxter-robot.html). Most autonomous robots require highly-trained workers and painstaking programming, calibrating, and testing. These requirements are often unacceptable for businesses that expect capital equipment to be 100 percent operational within days, if not hours of shipment, without hiccups. Although efforts like the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Open Source Computer Vision (OpenCV) are trying to simplify tasks and requirements to have robots up and running and doing useful things, they’re still mostly used by experienced roboticists with PhD degrees. Would the personal computer have been as popular as it is today if they booted to a command prompt? They probably would amongst developers, but not among the masses that drove the PC, and later the Internet, revolutions. Standard CAD/CAM/Gerber/toolpath generators made automated machine tools a no-brainer. We need the equivalent for robotics.
